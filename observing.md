## Observing experience
I have worked with many telescopes accross the entire electromagnetic spectrum with experience in the preparation/execution of observations and data reduction of:
- Radio: ATCA, VLA, uGMRT, LBA, eMERLIN
- Optical/near-infrared: LBT, VLT, TNG, Gemini-South, AAT, Magellan
- X-ray: Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT

&nbsp;

First-hand observations:
- Certified observed for the ATCA radio telescope, with more than 60 hours of observations.
- Certified observed for the LBA radio array, with more than 20 hours of observations.
- Several nights of observations with different optical telescopes (AAT, TNG, NTT).
