## Observing Experience

I work with many telescopes across the entire electromagnetic spectrum and I have experience in the preparation-execution-reduction of multi-wavelength data. 
Below I list all the successful proposals I submitted as Principal Investigator.
Overall, I have accumulated over 270 h of observations with radio/sub-mm arrays, about 200 h with optical/NIR telescopes and about 800 ksec with X-ray telescopes.
