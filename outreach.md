## Outreach & Public Engagement

Over the past few years, I have been actively involved in several outreach initiatives with the Harvard College Observatory, including public lectures and participation in astronomy events at the Observatory’s outreach stand.

- **National television and radio appearances (Italy)** – Invited to discuss my research and black hole physics (see [News section](./news.html)). 
- **Woburn High School** – Invited speaker; presented a talk on black holes to high school students.
- **[Public Observatory Nights](https://hco.cfa.harvard.edu/outreach/public-observatory-nights/)**, Harvard College Observatory – Invited speaker, “Black Hole Jetstreams: The Most Powerful Engines in the Universe.”
- **Podcast interview** – “Karolina Asks the Universe: Massive Black Holes and Jets.”
-  **Outreach event participation** – “Historic Change: Celebrating the Life and Legacy of Dr. Vera Rubin.”
