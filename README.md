# Welcome to my webpage !

My name is Luca Ighina and I am a Post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Astrophysics (Harvard and Smithsonian) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\
I study the most distant supermassive black hole in our Universe using the largest and most sensitive telescopes on the ground and in space.
