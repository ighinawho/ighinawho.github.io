# Welcome to my webpage !

My name is Luca Ighina and I am a Post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Astrophysics (Harvard and Smithsonian) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\
I received my PhD in 2024 from the Insubria University (Como, IT) and INAF-Brera observatory (Milano, IT).
I am lucky enough to look at the night sky and wonder where everything comes from as a job.
