# Welcome to my webpage !

My name is Luca Ighina, and Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
My work consists in studying how galaxies and black holes in our Universe formed and evolved and I could not love it more.
I received my PhD in 2024 from the Insubria University and INAF-Brera observatory (Italy).

<!-- how the study the most distant supermassive black hole in our Universe using the largest and most sensitive telescopes on the ground and in space.-->
