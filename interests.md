# Outside Academia

Outside of work I enjoy multiple activities, mainly involving fresh air and sunny days.

I consider myself an active person with a wide range of interests. I love anything related to the
ocean—surfing, beach volleyball, sailing, and snorkeling— and I also enjoy spending time in
the mountains. Growing up in a small town near the beautiful Italian Alps, I developed a deep
appreciation for hiking, often taking multi-day trips immersed in nature. I also enjoy climbing
(indoors and outdoors) and playing tennis whenever I get the chance.

Cooking is my favourite way to unwind after a long day. I have been cooking since I was a
child, thanks to my mum, and I believe a good dinner shared with friends/family is the perfect
way to spend a weekend evening.

In the past year, I have discovered a love for running. Despite being new to the sport, I have
completed over ten official half marathons, and I even placed on the podium of my age group
a few times.

Lastly, I have a deep love for animals. 

I also have a deep love for animals and try to volunteer in dog and cat shelters as much as I can. 
This is a way for me to stay connected to animals while giving back to the community.
If you have time, please check put these amazing places that are helping dogs and cats finding a new home:


After moving out of my family home, I missed having a
furry companion, so I began volunteering at dog and cat shelters in every city I have lived in
as a way to stay connected to animals while giving back to the community.


Please support these fantastic shelters if you can:
