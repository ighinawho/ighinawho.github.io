# Research Interests:

During my research I study supermassive massive black holes (SMBHs) in the primordial Universe. 
In particular, I focus on Active Galactic Nuclei (or Quasars) able to expel part of the accreting material in the form of two bipolar jets of relativistic particles.
To this end, I use some of the most sensitive telescopes currently available across the electromagnetic spectrum.


Here is some text that will wrap around the image. You can write multiple paragraphs here, and it will continue to flow next to the image.


### Search for Jetted Quasars in the primordial Universe

SMBHs in the primordial Universe, z>5, are extremely rare sources, especially those hosting relativistic jets. 
For this reason, dedicated searches are need to select and identify such objects. 
As part of my work I combine deep multi-wavelength surveys that cover a large fraction of the sky in order to select good high-z jetted quasar candidates. 
Once a well-defined sample is built, I perform dedicated spectroscopic observations with some of the largest ground based telescopes currently available in order to have a reliable estimate of the redshift of the candidates. 
For example, in Ighina et al. 2025 we built the largest well-defined sample of jetted quasars at z>5 currently available. 
The candidate selection in this work was based on the RACS radio surveys (see figure on the left) performed with the ASKAP telescope in Western Australia.
