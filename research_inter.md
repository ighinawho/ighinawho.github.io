# Research Interests:

During my research I study supermassive massive black holes (SMBHs) in the primordial Universe. 
In particular, I focus on Active Galactic Nuclei (or Quasars) able to expel part of the accreting material in the form of two bipolar jets of relativistic particles.
To this end, I use some of the most sensitive telescopes currently available across the electromagnetic spectrum.


Here is some text that will wrap around the image. You can write multiple paragraphs here, and it will continue to flow next to the image.


### Search for new Jetted Quasars in the primordial Universe

SMBHs in the primordial Universe, z>5, are extremely rare sources, especially those hosting relativistic jets. FOr this reason,

### Multi-wavelength characterisation of high-z Jetted Quasars


### Characterise the emission and evolution of kilo-parsec scale jets
